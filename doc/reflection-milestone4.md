TA Amanat provided us with some helpful suggestions, which we have addressed as follows:

Firstly,  we have added tooltips to certain charts to make them more interactive as per TA Amanat's recommendation. 

Secondly, we had initially planned to incorporate a search option for keywords instead of a dropdown menu, as recommended by TA Amanat. However, due to a heavy workload, we were unable to implement this feature as originally intended. Instead, we added more selection options to the charts to address this concern, as discussed.
